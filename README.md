### Hi there 👋


I am a junior developer with a background as a preschool teacher, also have some experience with graphic design. I am highly motivated to constantly learn and improve my skills as a developer. My passion for creating and solving problems, combined with my eye for aesthetics, make me well-suited for the field of software development. I am committed to becoming a great developer and excited to tackle the challenges that come with it.
